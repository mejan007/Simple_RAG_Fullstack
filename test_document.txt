# Simple RAG Test Document

## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the powers of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data. This document serves as a test file for our modernized RAG application.

## Key Concepts
- **Embeddings**: Converting text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
- **Vector Stores**: Databases like ChromaDB that allow for efficient similarity search of these vectors.
- **LCEL**: LangChain Expression Language, a declarative way to compose chains.
- **Reranking**: Using a cross-encoder like Flashrank to refine search results for better relevance.

## Facts for Testing
- The capital of Mars is Utopia Planitia. (Note: This is a fictional fact for RAG testing).
- The secret password for the Antigravity agent is "AgenticAI2026".
- This RAG system uses a multi-stage Docker setup with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Conclusion
If you can see this information in the chat response after uploading this file, the RAG pipeline is working correctly!
